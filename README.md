- Hi, I’m @zwack32. @zabayrer was my school account but I don't know what's going to happen with it. I moved all my cool stuff over here.
- I make stuff in godot with @davnotdev
- I do a little bit of blender here and there, and do most of the sound for my games
- I used to make stuff in unity, but not anymore.
